# CREST-WORKSHOP-101  
**FOR MLSA**

---

## üéØ Overview  
Welcome to **CREST WORKSHOP 101** ‚Äî a hands-on AI and ML foundational workshop curated for the **Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors (MLSA)** community.  
This repository is designed to help participants understand and explore the **core principles of Artificial Intelligence, Generative AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs)** through simple examples and practical exercises.

## üß† Learning Goals  
By the end of this workshop, participants will:
- Understand the foundations of **AI and Generative AI**.  
- Grasp the **architecture of transformers and LLMs**.  
- Learn **prompt engineering** techniques and experiment with creative prompting.  
- Explore **AI safety** and **jailbreaking scenarios**.  
- Execute a **toy LLM** script (`minillm.py`) for hands-on learning.  
- Gain confidence to move into more advanced AI/ML and NLP projects.
